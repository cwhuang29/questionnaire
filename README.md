# questionnaire

This questionnaire website is developed to facilitate researchers in the department of psychology.
This website helps researchers get rid of manually creating tons of Google Forms and recording hundreds of respondents through excel files. Researchers can create questionnaires, assign them to students, and send email notifications, after which students are able to fill them out online. Once the questionnaires have been collected, the researchers can manage, group by, and do statistics on them.
