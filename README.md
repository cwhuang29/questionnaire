# questionnaire

I develop this questionnaire website to facilitate researchers in the department of psychology. This website helps researchers get rid of manually managing tons of Google Forms and hundreds of respondents. Researchers can create questionnaires and assign them to students via email notification, after which students are able to fill them out online. Once the questionnaires have been collected, the researchers can manage, group by, and do statistics on them.
